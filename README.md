### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze health insurance data using SQL to uncover insights and patterns. The analysis includes various tasks such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and specific queries to answer business questions related to health insurance claims.

### Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It includes information on health insurance claims, policyholders, and other relevant data.

### Tools
Excel

MySQL

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
The data cleaning process involved the following steps:

1. Handling missing values.
2. Removing duplicates.
3. Loading the dataset into the SQL database.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the dataset better and to identify any initial patterns or anomalies. This involved:

- Descriptive statistics
- Identifying correlations

## Data Analysis
Specific SQL queries were designed to answer key questions, such as:

- Total number of claims by insurance type
- Average claim amount by age group
- Distribution of claims over time

```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(age), 0) AS avg_age, MIN(age) AS min_age, MAX(age) AS max_age,
    ROUND(AVG(bmi), 2) AS avg_bmi, MIN(bmi) AS min_bmi, MAX(bmi) AS max_bmi,
    ROUND(AVG(charges), 2) AS avg_charges, MIN(charges) AS min_charges, MAX(charges) AS max_charges
FROM insurance_data;
```

### Results/Findings
The key findings from the analysis include:

- Patterns in claim amounts by age group.
- Differences in the number of claims by insurance type.
- Temporal trends in claims data.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

- Focus on high-claim age groups for targeted interventions.
- Optimize claim processes for the most common insurance types.
- Monitor seasonal trends to predict claim surges.

### Limitations
The limitations of this analysis include:

- Potential biases in the dataset.
- Limited scope to only the provided dataset.
- Assumptions made during data cleaning and analysis.
